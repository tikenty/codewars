/* ❓DESCRIPTION
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
    If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

    The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

    name + " plays banjo"
name + " does not play banjo"
Names given are always valid strings.
 */

/*SOLUTION */

function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
    const firstChar = name.charAt(0);

    if(firstChar.toLowerCase() === "r") {
        return name + " plays banjo"
    }
    else{
        return name + " does not play banjo"
    }
}

console.log(areYouPlayingBanjo("Tlek"));
